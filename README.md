### Day 1: July 18, 2018

### Day 2: July 19, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed Smart Contract to Rinkeby test network

**Thoughts** Tried to sync with the Rinkeby test network via `geth` but I got stuck on the last 60-70 blockes. Eventually solved this by running `geth` with the `--light` flag

### Day 3: July 20, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed ICO website to github pages

**Thoughts** I struggled with loading all my css and js files with the right paths, because for some weird reason the `app.js` file couldn't be accessed via github pages.
