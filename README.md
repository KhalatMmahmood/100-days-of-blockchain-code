# 100 Days Of Blockchain Code - Log

## 100 Days Of Blockchain Code is a pledge to dedicate at least 1 hour of studying or coding to blockchain development for 100 days
Inspired by [Siraj Raval's 100 Days Of ML Code challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo)


### Day 1: July 18, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Written First Smart Contract and began with coding front-end for ICO website.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with having a test-driven development mindset. But getting the hang of it now.

### Day 2: July 19, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed Smart Contract to Rinkeby test network

**Thoughts** Tried to sync with the Rinkeby test network via `geth` but I got stuck on the last 60-70 blocks. Eventually solved this by running `geth` with the `--light` flag.

### Day 3: July 20, 2018
##### Coding My Own Cryptocurrency on Ethereum

**Today's Progress**: Deployed ICO website to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** I struggled with loading all my css and js files with the right paths because for some weird reason the `app.js` file couldn't be accessed via GitHub pages.

### Day 4: July 21, 2018
##### Coding My First DApp on Ethereum (Election DApp)

**Today's Progress**: Got started on coding the Election Smart Contract and added boiler plate code for the front-end.

**Thoughts** I did some more research on ES6 Promises and found a cleaner way of writing promise chains with `async` and `await` instead of `.then(() => {})`. I also learned about the difference between a `mapping`, `array` and `struct` in Solidity.
